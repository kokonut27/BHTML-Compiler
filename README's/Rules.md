## Rules for using BHTML and License
#### You don't have neccarily read all of the license, however, if you're going to use this language, there are some simple and straight forward rules you have to follow.
1. If you're going to use it, and make something, it would be *appreciated* if you credited me.
2. You can change the code by forking it, but if you try and merging it, you have to ask permission to do so. You have to do it automatically, but I'm making sure.

#### There wasn't too much to add, but please don't do anything bad to it or change it too much. Thank you!
