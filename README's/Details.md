## Functions and details
#### Currently, the language hasn't 'developed' much yet. So far, I have added comments and `<p>` tags. Another thing I should mention is that it currently prints in the *console*, so I'm planning on extending it to the web, using flask or just plain html.

#### Also, it restricts some whitespaces, and allows some whitespaces. For example, inside bhtml tags, whitespace is *not* restricted, but in the plain bhtml code, whitespace might be restricted.
