## Contributing to BHTML (Compiler)
#### If you want to contribute to this language, I won't invite you, unless I need absoloute help. So if you want to help in some way, or give suggestions, if you could leave PR's on the [github page](https://github.com/JBYT27/BHTML-Compiler), that would help! 

#### Also, if you can't leave any PR's, or don't have github, try contacting my discord (it's `haha Ã©#5634`). Please don't spam it, or else I will block you and report you. Thanks!
