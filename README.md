## Introduction
#### This language is named BHTML, as said above, Boosted-Hyper-Text-Markup-Language. What it means is that it will be the regular HTML, but with better and easier syntax, more flexible with whitespace, and so forth. I won't include too much details, as it will be included in the docs (coming soon for now).

> I should note that this is the compiler, not exactly the whole language, but the compiler.
